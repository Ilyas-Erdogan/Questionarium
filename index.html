        <p class = about-section>Questionarium is a questionaire mini-forum for teachers and students. 
            Students anonymously submit questions and everyone can see what was asked. 
            If someone has the same question, they can click the "I have this question too!" button.
            That way, the teacher will know how many students are struggling and if something needs to be reviewed.
            It saves space and creates less clutter inside a chatroom for video meeting services such as
            Zoom, Google Meets, and Microsoft Teams.
